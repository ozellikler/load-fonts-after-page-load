<h1>Load Fonts After Page Load</h1>
<br>
The opening speed of the site is of great importance in Google algorithms. The size of the CSS code you use and the loading of the fonts you use with CSS have a great impact on this speed.
<br><br>
This little JavaScript code adds your font CSS files <i>(into head tags)</i>, which take a long time to load, to the page after the page is loaded. Thus, the opening speed of the site increases. You can see this on the PageSpeed Insights site.
<br><br>
Activate this code when the page is loaded, or activate it when the user scrolls down.
<br><br>
Enjoy.
